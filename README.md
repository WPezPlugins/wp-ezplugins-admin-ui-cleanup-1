WP ezPlugins Admin UI Cleanup
=============================

Facilitates numerous changes to the WP dashboard and Admin UI in order to improve UX, data quality and application security.


Important
=========

This plugin leans on a number of classes in the WP ezClasses framework (https://github.com/WPezClasses). While it can be used in production "as is", it is essentially for demonstration purposes. It is presumed that you will use this plugin as a starting point for your own custom version; which will lean on WP ezClasses, of course.

For example, you might want a different set a presets / combinations for a particular project / client. With minimal effort you can create a custom plugin for that particular need.
